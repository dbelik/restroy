# Pipeline Utilities

The Pipeline Utilities module is a TypeScript library that offers a comprehensive set
of classes and functions specifically designed to simplify working with pipelines. In
this module, pipelines are conceptualized as graphs, where each node in the graph
represents a specific task or step, and the edges between the nodes define the flow
and dependencies between these tasks.

By utilizing the Pipeline Utilities module in your TypeScript projects, you can
streamline the development and management of complex pipelines. It provides a solid
foundation for building sophisticated automation systems, data processing workflows,
or any application that relies on the execution of interconnected tasks. The modular
and extensible nature of the library allows for easy integration with other TypeScript
or JavaScript frameworks and libraries, enabling you to build robust and scalable
pipeline-based applications.
